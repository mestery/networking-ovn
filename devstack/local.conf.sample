# The DevStack plugin defaults to using the ovn branch from the official ovs
# repo.  You can optionally use a different one.  For example, you may want to
# use the latest patches in blp's ovn branch:

# single-node deployments, enable them on the controller node. For
# multi-node deployments, consider disabling them on the controller
# node and enabling them on the compute node(s) to provide a more
